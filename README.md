# Linux setup scripts and rc files
Linux setup scripts and rc files for a new account with all my favorite features.

# Files

### **[bash_setup.sh](https://github.com/jamesapdx/rc_files/blob/master/bash_setup.sh)**
Increase history size, save history after each command, and make a custom red command prompt (user:dir).
### **[conky.conky](https://github.com/jamesapdx/rc_files/blob/master/conky.conky)**
A basic conky setup file.
### **[screenrc](https://github.com/jamesapdx/rc_files/blob/master/screenrc)**
For the linux screen command, this setup file creates a "region mode" then you only need press one key for easy operations
such as a new window split.
### **[setup_pycharm.sh](https://github.com/jamesapdx/rc_files/blob/master/setup_pycharm.sh)**
With this script you can simply cd into a directory and type "pycharm" to fire up pycharm.
### **[vim_shortcuts.md](https://github.com/jamesapdx/rc_files/blob/master/vim_shortcuts.md)**
Some of my favorite vim keys and commands, including numbering, macros, :norm, spelling, search/replace, and more.
### **[vimrc](https://github.com/jamesapdx/rc_files/blob/master/vimrc)**
Add a red line at column 120, 4 space tabs, save as root map, ctr-/ commenting like an IDE, save history between sessions, enable
virtualedit mode which allows you to move your cursor anywhere, including whitespace, and more.
